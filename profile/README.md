The Coral Decision-Support Modeling Group is a multi-institutional collaboration that develops and integrates quantitative models to inform coral reef management and restoration. The group synthesizes ecological data, environmental drivers, and management actions to produce decision-ready tools that evaluate trade-offs, forecast outcomes, and support transparent, evidence-based decision-making for coral reefs.
